That's a litle project that i simply wanted to do because i'm learning HTML, CSS & Javascript, and on my third day learning these things i thought
"Why not i just create a Minecraft website to pratice what i'm learning?" And i did that.

I think i don't have anything more to say, all code is there and i think i'll update this little project soon.
